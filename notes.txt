## Symlinks ##
Symlinks play poorly together. As of 2008.11, there seem to be three
distinct types:

* Cygwin (which creates lnk files which only it interprets)
* MSys (which seems to create hard links or copies which confound everyone)
* NTFS links, via mklink (which everyone follows transparently, but cygwin doesn't label as links

There are problems e.g. with ntemacs traversing Cygwin symlinks. The
best solution in general is to use NTFS links wherever possible.
